## READING RESPONSE

This week I listened to "Your interview is tomorrow? Here's some last minute advice" by the Developer Tea Podcast.
In a nutshell, the author suggests counter intuitive means to prepare for job interviews. Such include thinking about
what you're grateful for to put you in a positive state, and using visualization to envision how you'd like to feel during the
interview, as well as predict possible objections. The overall philosophy in this article is: cramming information
last minute, increasing anxiety, losing sleep and being in a bad head space are terrible for interviews.

This podcast episode suggests that you'll never have a moment of "arrival", and will be constantly learning. So instead of stressing over knowing
everything, focus on things that will make you an effective communicator. This kind of reminds me of what happened to a charismatic buddy of mine.
During his Twitter job interview, he had a very small grasp of the tasks they'd require for the job, yet somehow nailed the interview. After
getting the job, he eventually learned everything needed to do his job.

I strongly agree with this podcast episode. There are countless studies that support the effectiveness of positivity and the effectiveness of visualizations.
This, of course, can be taken too far, to where an individual might focus so much on putting themselves in a positive state that they neglect the technicalities
of a job interview, ie not knowing their stuff, failing to proofread their resume, ect. But the author counts these technicalities as pre requisites to the interview.





## HOMEWORK 8: MORE PRACTICE WITH LOOPS
> * Due date: Midnight on Wednesday, 10/25 (1 week)
> * Part I: Setting up your new homework branch
> * Part II: Coding Homework
> * Part III: Submit

## Part I: GitHub Setup
1. Using the Terminal, navigate to your mmart-168-fall2017 git repository: `$ cd {your git repository path} #different for everyone`
2. Check out the master branch: `$ git checkout master`
3. Pull the most recent changes from the upstream repository: `$ git pull --rebase upstream master`
4. Create a new branch to do Homework 8: `$ git branch homework08`
5. Checkout your new homework08 branch: `$ git checkout homework08`
6. Verify that you are now on the new branch: `$ git branch` (check that your new homework08 branch has an asterisk next to it).

## Part II: Coding
### A. While Loops
Using a while loop, print a message (any message you want) 100 times, using the **appendListElement** function.

### B. Writing to the DOM, using a Loop
Using a for loop, write out each personâ€™s avatar, name, and score, based on the **people** array


## Part III: Submit
1. Just as in Part II, open your Terminal and type: `$ git status`. It should tell you which files you've changed.
2. To "commit" all of your changes, type: ` $ git commit -am 'Completed homework 8'`
3. To "push" your change to up to your github account, type: `$ git push --set-upstream origin homework08`
4. Finally, verify that your changes are up on GitHub by logging into your GitHub account and taking a look at your newly created homework08 branch.
5. **Submit your homework by pasting a link to your branch into the Moodle.**
